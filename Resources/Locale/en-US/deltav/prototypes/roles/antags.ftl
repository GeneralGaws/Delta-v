roles-antag-spaceferret-name = Legally Distinct Space Ferret
roles-antag-spaceferret-objective = Find as much food as possible, then hibernate in a gas scrubber.
spaceferret-role-briefing = You're a small, potentially-innocent creature lost on a big, scary space station. Eat as much food as you need to hibernate, then hibernate in a gas scrubber. You have no time limit, but leaving on the evac shuttle does NOT count as a draw or lesser success. Your hibernating body does not need to survive the remaining round, so feel free to clock out once you've had your fun.
