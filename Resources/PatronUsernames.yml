# --------
# This file contains mappings from Patreon names to Wizden/SS14 usernames.
# An entry can be created here if someone's Patreon name differs from their
# SS14 username. If a person is no longer a Patreon and thus absent
# from Patrons.yml, the mapping is simply ignored. This makes it generally
# unnecesary to ever remove mappings.

# Example entry. Please replace it with the first REAL entry.
# Do NOT remove the only entry, as it causes YAML parsing to fail.
